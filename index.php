Genesis 1:3: Then God said, Let there be light; and there was light.
<p /> 
We encounter sounds, words, languages and numbers all the time in our life.
But we did not stop to think over-and-over about what they mean. They were
stored deeply in our mind but can not be retrieved. We just lightly joke ourself forgetful.
<p />
Memory is all about how to retrieve the information already stored.
<p />
The following tool is meant to shed some light on how to retrieve and connect information stored
along the time by different people in different time, different locations and with different interest.
<p />
We would like to call this tool as Amen Dictionary - a dictionary of numbers, words, verses, and natural language.
When you input a number or a phrase, you will see a list of words or phrases in either chinese, chinese pinyin or english.
If you encounter any familiar things, you need to think how to understand their interconnectedness.
<p />
The 2nd phase we are working on is to allow you input your notes and your quotes into the system and help to grow
our dictionary.
